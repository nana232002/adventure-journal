        <h1>The Food We Eat...</h1>
        <p>
            This article focuses on those aspects that are closely related to the food choices mothers make on daily basis. Everyday food choices, such as what we eat,
            how much we eat, what quality our food has, or where our food comes from,
            are highly influencing our life quality. For a better understanding of food-related behaviour,
            we have collected data through a self-administered questionnaire,
            which was disseminated in a closed Facebook group (more than 2,200 members during data collection) formed by mothers from Miercurea Ciuc (Romania) and its surroundings.
